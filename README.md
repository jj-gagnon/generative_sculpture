### Description
This version is where I transfered my python code to threejs. So this represents a lot of work that I did in python as well. 

The blocks are placed randomly in the x and z axis, as y position increments continuously for each block. 

Each branch gets a new random color. 


### Parameters
Total number of blocks
Number of branches to maintain
Length of each branch.
