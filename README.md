### Description
Instead of randomly placing blocks and branching sometimes, this model will branch every time and rotate pieces by a consistent amount. 


### Parameters
- Rotation of pieces
- Left and right branch angles can be controlled separately
- Angles can be determined by factors such as branch height in the tree, or horizontal index. This can allow for very interesting complexity.
